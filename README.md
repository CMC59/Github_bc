# Git command slide by ME

Here's what I learned during the github bootcamp

⚡️ I already knew a few of the git commands I use regularly in my company, but this bootcamp helped me learn a few more!

The slides were made with ❤️ [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/).

> "Git seamlessly utilizes an SSH tunnel for secure communication when pushing and pulling changes from a remote repository."
